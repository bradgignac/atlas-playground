# atlas-playground

Atlas Playground demonstrates how to use [Hashicorp Atlas](https://atlas.hashicorp.com) to develop, deploy, and monitor applications. It uses Docker to package individual services, Vagrant for building and sharing development environments, Terraform for provisioning infrastructure, and Consul for service discovery.

## System Requirements

- [Vagrant 1.5 or higher](http://vagrantup.com)

## Getting Started

To spin up your development environment, simply run `vagrant up`. This will spin up a CoreOS development box running the Docker daemon.
